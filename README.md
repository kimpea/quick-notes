# Quick Notes

A simple note-taking application made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. 

This app will be useful for:
 - To do lists
 - Shopping lists
 - Live note-taking while watching a video or lecture
 - Things to remember

When a task is complete, the user can click on one of the list items and it will be highlighted in green. 
To remove an item, click on the 'X'. 
Refreshing the page will remove all list items.
